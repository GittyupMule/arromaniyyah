A Latin-script keyboard for the Arabic language.

## Wait, why would anyone want this?
There are three primary use cases I can think of:

### 1) Language learners
Arabic has one of the more unwieldy scripts. It fits the language's syntax extremely well, but is rather irritating for second language learners to aquire, due to the fact that short vowels are not usually written, and in the spoken language the difference between tenuis and pharyngealized consonants can be extremely subtle at times. Take, for instance, the name "Yazid" (يَزِيْد, written unvocalized as يزيد). A second language learner will have three sticking points:

* Is the "a" short (fathah, normally unwritten) or long (alif)?

* Is the "i" short (kasrah, normally unwritten) or long (ya)?

* Is the "d" tenuis (dal) or pharyngealized (dad)?

Latin script will represent the name as "Yazid" regardless of these differences.

### 2) Literacy
Morocco's literacy rate is 70%. Iraq's is 44%. Latin script is probably easier to learn? (Studies would be appreciated.)

### 3) Efficiency
Many keyboard layouts are terrible. Arabic's default one takes the cake. It groups together letters that are shaped similarly, with no regard to hand alternation or rolling action. QWERTY, even with is faults, is better in this way. Some people probably just type faster in QWERTY.
